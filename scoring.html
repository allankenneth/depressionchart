<h1>Major Depression Inventory (MDI): Scoring Instruction</h1>
<h2>A: As a diagnostic instrument for DSM-IV major depression</h2>
<p>The diagnostic demarcation line indicates at which point a symptom is severe enough to be used in the DSM-IV algorithm of major depression. Thus, the first three symptoms should have been present at least "most of the time" during the past two weeks, while the other symptoms should have been present "more than half" of the period. For symptoms 4 and 5, only the highest score should be used, as the DSM-IV contains only 9 of the 10 MDI symptoms and as symptoms 4 and 5 belong to the same category in DSM-IV. For symptoms 8 and 10, only the one of the two alternatives (a or b) with the highest score is considered.</p>
<p>Major depression is diagnosed if 5 or more of the 9 symptoms (items 4 and 5 combined) have been present in the past two weeks and if symptom 1 or symptom 2 are included in these 5 symptoms.</p>

<h2>B: As a depression rating scale</h2>
<p>As a severity measure, the MDI score ranges from 0 to 50, since each of the 10 items can be scored from 0 (at no time) to 5 (all the time). Again, for items 8 and 10, alternative a or b with the highest score is considered.</p>
