<p>This app is still in very early development. It gives you a score, but not much else (it doesn't even display past results). Yet.</p>

<h2>Major Depression Inventory?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Major Depression Inventory (MDI) is a self-report mood questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization. The instrument was constructed by a team led by Professor Per Bech, a psychiatrist based at Frederiksborg General Hospital in Denmark.[1] The MDI differs from many other self-report inventories, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), because it is able to generate an ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnosis of depression in addition to an estimate of symptom severity.[2][3]</p>
<p>Unlike many other similar instruments, the MDI is available free of charge and can be downloaded from the internet with a full manual and scoring instructions. This makes it an attractive option in epidemiological population surveys. It has also been translated into seven languages.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>To measure treatment outcome the sum of the ten items is used. A higher score signifies deeper depression.</p>
<p>When using the scale to diagnose depression according to ICD-10, there are the following possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>Mild depression:</strong> A score of 4 or 5 in two of the first three items. Plus a score of at least 3 on two or three of the last seven items.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate depression:</strong> A score of 4 or 5 in two or three of the first three items. Plus a score of at least 3 on four of the last seven items.</p>
<p><strong>Severe depression:</strong> A score of 4 or 5 in all of the first three items. Plus a score of at least 3 on five or more of the last seven items.</p>
<p><strong>Major depression:</strong> The number of items is reduced to nine, as Item 4 is part of Item 5. Include whichever of the two items has the highest score (item 4 or 5). A score on at least five items is required, to be scored as follows: the score on the first three items must be at least 4, and on the other items at least 3. Either Item 1 or 2 must have a score of 4 or 5.</p>
<h3>Depression <em>Graph</em>?</h3>
<!--Depression Graph is an application written by me as a side-project to help me learn the Python programming language and to help with my own depression. I'm a front-end web developer by trade, and this project seemed natural.
-->
<p>DepressionGraph.com renders, specifically, a summative score of the ten questions (the higher score of 8a/b and 10a/b is used) in the MDI, but currently <em>not a ICD-10 diagnoses</em>. I have plans to incorporate both aspects of the inventory into the system, but the ICD-10 diagnoses algorithm isn't quite solid yet.</p>
<p>Additionally, DepressgionGraph.com allows you to store your questionnaire results and plots your progress on a timeline, allowin you to get sense of the direction of your treatment. Your results are stored locally on your device; they are not transmitted over the internet. At a further date, I do plan to intgrate an encrypted cloud-based backup service.</p>
