<p>This app is still in very early development. It gives you a score, but not much else (it doesn't even display past results). Yet.</p>

<h2>Graph.</h2>
<p>Each of your inventories is archived, its score graphed on a chart. Watch your progression over time and help determine the course of your treatment.</p>
<h2>Share.</h2>
<p>Email the results of individual tests to whomever you choose, including your doctor or loved ones; help them help you.</p>
<h2>Get Better.</h2>
<p>Having a stable reminder of your progress can help bolster confidence in your treatment, and maybe even help speed it along.</p>
<h3>What is the MDI?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Major Depression Inventory (MDI) is a self-report mood questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization. The instrument was constructed by a team led by Professor Per Bech, a psychiatrist based at Frederiksborg General Hospital in Denmark.[1] The MDI differs from many other self-report inventories, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), because it is able to generate an ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnosis of depression in addition to an estimate of symptom severity.[2][3]</p>
<p>Unlike many other similar instruments, the MDI is available free of charge and can be downloaded from the internet with a full manual and scoring instructions. This makes it an attractive option in epidemiological population surveys. It has also been translated into seven languages.</p>

<h3>What is Depression Graph?</h3>
<!--Depression Graph is an application written by me as a side-project to help me learn the Python programming language and to help with my own depression. I'm a front-end web developer by trade, and this project seemed natural.
-->
<p>DepressionGraph.com renders, specifically, Major Depression Inventory scores, not a DSM IV score. I have plans to incorporate both scores into the system, but for now, the following formula is used to determine your scores:</p>
<p>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + (8a or 8b) + 9 (10a or 10b)</p>
